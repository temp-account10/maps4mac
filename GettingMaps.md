You can get smaller (country / state sized) extracts from [CloudMade](http://downloads.cloudmade.com/). Note that the CloudMade extracts are a bit buggy and sometimes may fail to import, but they're currently the only option for small North American imports.

For European countries you can use [GeoFabrik (Europe)](http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/europe/).

If you have PostGIS set up you can also use the large .pbf files provided by [GeoFabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/), these cover very larger areas (e.g. All of Europe, All of South America).

More info on OpenStreetMap map extracts can be found here on [the OSM Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm#Extracts).
